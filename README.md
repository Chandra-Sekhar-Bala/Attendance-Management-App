**So we thought lets Smart the  traditional Attendance taking system**.And thatâ€™s how we landed with our android application.

2. Youâ€™ll be landed to homepage at Database section by default (if you had old data let it load)
3. Create a Stream or class by giving name and click add button
4. Now go inside that stream and create students
5. Press on take attendance button and youâ€™ll be moved to
6. attendance section with our student details.
Now all students are shown in a queue of card
